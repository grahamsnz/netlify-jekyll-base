##Planning & Coordinating##

Our members hold weekly technical meetings to discuss and coordinate efforts in dev/ops surrounding our favourite open telecom projects. Frequent technical meetings help synchronize the common and individual resources of our members. 

Our volunteer directors hold board meetings at least once per month and often more frequently. Frequent board meetings means that shared OTF resources and funds can be properly allocated with little delay.
