##Providing Resources & Financial Support##

Each OTF member operates carrier-grade open telecom infrastructure in various parts of the world: Australia, Canada, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Uruguay, USA. Members are happy to contribute compute and connectivity resources. Together we can help provide the resources independent software developers may need to get your idea or project off the ground. 

OTF operations are conducted on on a volunteer basis. Our membership fees help the OTF take care of accounting and basic filing requirements. We are able to raise extra funds for enhancements and new projects based on the technical merits and overall beneficial user impact. Please let us know how we might help get your idea of the ground!
