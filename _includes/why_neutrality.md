##Neutrality##

The Open Telecom Foundation was created as a neutral organization where we can all meet and find ways to collaborate. Although some of our members may compete directly or indirectly with each other in their commercial worlds, they collaborate with each other as members of the Open Telecom Foundation. We invite you to enhance the Open Telecom Foundation by participating. Weâ€™d love to hear your ideas!
