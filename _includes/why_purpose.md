##Our Purpose##

The Open Telecom Foundation is a not-for-profit collaboration between a group of community members who are passionate about open source projects and open protocols that facilitate open telecommunications. 

All of the Open Telecom Foundationâ€™s members are directly involved in providing carrier-grade telecom services each and every day. If this sounds like you, become a member!

If your organization or you personally are involved in providing carrier-grade telecom services or would like to support projects that support providing carrier-grade telecom services, please become a member.
