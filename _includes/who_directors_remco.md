**Remco van Vugt**
(Breda, The Netherlands)

Remco has been interested in everything technical from a very early age, which finally converged into IT during his teenage years. Learning to work with Linux in the late 1990s sparked his interest in open source.

In the mid-2000s Remco obtained a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Utrecht in the field of Information Sciences. He learned the key aspects of how businesses use IT from a strategic perspective alongside the essentials of software engineering. Halfway through university, Remco co-founded the IT support and service company named Raffel in The Netherlands.

Right after founding Raffel, the disruptive technology of Voice over IP started to emerge. Raffel jumped on this bandwagon in 2007 by starting to resell wholesale voice services and added telecommunications to its service portfolio. Soon the need arises for more features; custom Asterisk 1.4 boxes were the answer. However solving the problem at first, this solution was not scaling and the maintenance of several independent boxes was troublesome. From 2010 onward, Raffel became the independent carrier and phone company it is today, maintaining a dedicated telephony platform based on open source technology. Raffel will be celebrating its 10-year anniversary in October 2017!

Remco acquired his master’s degree in System and Network engineering from the University of Amsterdam in 2014. This in depth technical education helped Remco to understand the key techniques of networking and systems used to build today’s telecommunications platforms.

Remco is dedicated to use his experience and knowledge to contribute to the OTF as a director.
