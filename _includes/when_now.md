The Open Telecom Foundation is always interested in connecting with folks who care about open source telecommunications projects. 

Our members have been active in the open source telecommunications space for years and will continue to be for years to come. Weâ€™d be happy is you joined and we combined our resources. 

Our members hold weekly technical meetings to discuss and coordinate efforts in dev/ops surrounding our favourite open telecom projects. Frequent technical meetings of member help the common and individual resources of our members be better synchronized.
